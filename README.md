# BI-Templates Repository

This repository contains pre-built BI templates for business intelligence / analytics platforms, such as Power BI and Tableau. 
The templates provide the connection logic to connect to Arena’s REST API and download all data from an Arena workspace via the DataExtract service. 
In addition to downloading and parsing CSV files into individual tables based on Arena World/resources, the templates also contain pre-built reports for each of the worlds and can be further customized based on any custom reporting requirements.
 
Note: These templates are provided as-is as part of Arena Labs - experimental and new methods and examples that allow Arena customers to extend use of the Arena platform.
Arena will not support any custom report development needs that a customer may have as a result of using these templates. 
It is up to the customer to procure its own resources to customize and extend the reports based on the unique architecture for each BI application.
