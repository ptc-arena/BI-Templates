# Tableau Template Readme

The instructions for configuring the template are below â€“ please download the .TWB file prior to starting the setup process.

## Data Extract Setup (Pre-requisite)
<ol type="1">
<li>Set up a data extract scheduled setup in your Arena workspace settings 
<ol><li>1x per day is suggested but you can select any recurring period â€“ the template file only loads the latest run of Data Extract </li>

## ðŸ‘‹ Frequently Asked Questions
Q: I entered my credentials but the query keeps running and is stuck, what should I do?<br>
A: Cancel the query and make sure that you select the Data Source tab in the bottom-left. Sometimes trying to review the report first will not allow the Data Source table/column schema to be defined and a failure occurs during the download that the query screen doesnâ€™t capture. This will hopefully be fixed in a future enhancement to the template. When you click on Data Source, you may have to re-enter credentials, but once the schema is loaded, you will see a list of tables on the left side of the screen and the schema relationships on the main window. 
  Then you should be OK to click on each of the other Arena Dashboard tabs.
<br><br>

Q: I still need help, what should I do?<br>
A: Please contact your Arena Account Manager, Customer Success Coach, or Arena Support and weâ€™ll gladly review your connection issue and get your Power BI environment loaded with your Arena data.
